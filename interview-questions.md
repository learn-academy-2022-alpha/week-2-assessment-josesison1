# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameters serves a purpose of a placeholder variable and is defined inside parenthesis in the beginning of a function. While an argument are the actual values/content of data that is passed in the function invocation inside the parenthesis as well.

  Researched answer: Parameters are the names initialized in the functions declaration and arguments are the real values passed to the function call or in other words, when it is invoked.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() method is used in higher order functions that has the ability to contain 3 different type of parameters. These parameters are: value, index, and array. The way to list these parameters in the function signature must be in those exact order. The value parameter is a required parameter when this method is used. The index, and array parameters are optional.

  Researched answer: The .map() is a built in method used in higher order function. It has 3 built in parameters which includes: value, index, and array. What the parameters are named is arbitrary, but the order will always be the same. The .map method have to take and is required at least 1 parameter which is the value parameter, while the index and array parameters are optional.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map() and .filter() are both built in methods that are used in higher order functions. Both are used for iteration, but the big difference between the two is that, .map() iterates and returns the same amount of values, while .filter() iterates though values and could return a shorter/smaller amount of values.

  Researched answer: The .map() method iterates through an array and returns a new array containing updated values of the same length, while .filter() method iterates through an array and returns a new array with only the values that are truthy or the values that satify your given condition which will essentially return a shorter version or a smaller array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Functions are reusable block of code that can be called on through a function invocation and requires a return for an output. Methods are usually used within objects and classes so that it can perform specific actions. It is also a function or action that belong to an object.

  Researched answer: A function is a code block written to perform specific set of tasks. On a function declaration it is followed by a function name along with parameters, which are optional, arrow syntax and curly braces where the block of code goes. A method is a property of an object. The main difference between function and method is that, methods are associated with an object, while a function is not.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is creating a special type of variable that exposes a key inside an object.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows you to take something like an object and unpacks their values into individual variables, where you're essentially taking properties of an object and breaking them out into separate and recallable variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: This is my first time since I have never heard of the term hoisting in javascript. I have a background in construction since I was an electrician in my previous career, and hoisting is lifting up an item in the air by some type of heavy equipment or a crane. So to put that into a programming perspective, my guess for it is to rearrange a block of code so that it could be more accessible.

  Researched answer: After researching, hoisting in javascript refers to the process of moving the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to the execution of the code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Inheritance is useful for code reusability. Reuse properties and methods of an existing class. It also enables you to define a class that takes all functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.

2. React: React is an open-source javascript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

3. React state: is a plain javascript object used by react to represent an information about the components current situation.

4. React lifecycle methods: Life cycle contains of three main phases to include: mounting, updating, un-mounting.

5. DOM: also known as Document Object Model which is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content.
